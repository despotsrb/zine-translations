### translation guide

1. Install the ["Comic Relief" font](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/comic-relief) on your systems. It has glyphs for a lot of languages. If your language isn't included in that font, pick any font that you think will look good.
2. Use Inkscape (or something similar) to translate the SVG
3. Make a pull request with your translation
4. Once the full zine is translated, we can generate a PDF!

If you find any problems or have ideas for improving the process, please let me
know! We'll figure it out as we go along.

### how to generate a printable PDF

1. run (for example) `./scripts/convert_to_zine.sh english/zines/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard` to generate a PDF
2. you can make it printable with [this Python script](https://github.com/jvns/zine-formatter)

### inclusivity

In English it's pretty easy to be inclusive of all genders in language. I'd
like for translations to also be similarly inclusive (don't assume the reader
is male, etc). Let me know what approach you end up taking to this!
